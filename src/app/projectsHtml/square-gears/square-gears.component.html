	<p>These were created in SolidWorks using the toolbox addins. These gears were actually modeled by splitting a pinion gear into 4 equal quadrants (corners) and then creating 4 racks (sides) of similar pitch and thickness. Then I just put all these pieces together and used 'convert entites' and a simple extrusion to produce the square geometry.</p>
